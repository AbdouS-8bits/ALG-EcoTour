-- Baseline Migration
-- 
-- This migration establishes a baseline for the existing database schema.
-- The database was already populated with this schema before this migration was created.
-- 
-- Tables included in this baseline:
-- - users (with indexes on email, resetPasswordToken, verificationToken)
-- - eco_tours (with foreign key to categories)
-- - categories (with unique index on name)
-- - bookings (with foreign keys to users and eco_tours)
-- - reviews (with foreign keys to users and eco_tours)
-- - tour_images (with foreign key to eco_tours)
-- - admin_audit_logs (with foreign key to users)
--
-- This migration is marked as applied since the schema already exists in the database.
-- No changes will be made when this migration is applied.
